# Anagram-Checker
HTML/CSS/JS repository that checks if two inputs are anagrams.

The HTML, CSS, and JS files contain all of the code written during this project.
The remaining .png files are the icons for Linkedin, Github, and CV on the webpage. 
  They are referenced in the bottom of the index.HTML file.

Display colors were taken from Duolingo.com.
